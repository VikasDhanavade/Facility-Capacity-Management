# Facility Capacity Management Smart Contract

## Description

The Facility Capacity Management smart contract is a decentralized solution built on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language. This contract enables facility owners to create and manage venues with limited capacity, allowing users to book spots while ensuring the facility never exceeds its maximum capacity limit.

The contract provides a simple yet robust system for:
- Creating facilities with predefined capacity limits
- Tracking current occupancy in real-time
- Allowing users to book spots with automatic capacity validation
- Preventing overbooking through on-chain enforcement

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize facility management by providing a transparent, decentralized, and trustless system for capacity management. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to:

- **Eliminate Double Booking**: Ensure that facilities can never be overbooked through immutable smart contract logic
- **Provide Transparency**: All booking data is stored on-chain, providing complete transparency for both facility owners and users
- **Reduce Administrative Overhead**: Automate the booking process, reducing the need for manual intervention and administrative costs
- **Enable Trust**: Create a trustless environment where users and facility owners can interact without intermediaries
- **Support Scalability**: Provide a foundation that can scale from small venues to large-scale facility management systems

## Future Scope

The current implementation serves as a foundation for a comprehensive facility management ecosystem. Future enhancements will include:

### Phase 1 - Core Enhancements
- **Cancellation System**: Allow users to cancel bookings and free up capacity
- **Time-based Bookings**: Implement time slots and duration-based reservations
- **Payment Integration**: Add native token payments for booking fees
- **Refund Mechanism**: Automated refund system for cancelled bookings

### Phase 2 - Advanced Features
- **Multi-facility Support**: Allow single owners to manage multiple facilities
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Implement surge pricing based on demand and availability
- **Booking History**: Comprehensive tracking of user booking history
- **Reputation System**: Rating and review system for facilities and users

### Phase 3 - Enterprise Features
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different permission levels for facility staff
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive reporting and analytics for facility utilization
- **Integration APIs**: RESTful APIs for third-party integration
- **Mobile SDK**: Native mobile application support

### Phase 4 - Ecosystem Expansion
- **Cross-chain Compatibility**: Support for multiple blockchain networks
- **NFT Integration**: Booking confirmations as NFTs with potential benefits
- **DAO Governance**: Community governance for platform parameters
- **Marketplace**: Secondary market for booking transfers

## Usage

### Creating a Facility
```move
// Facility owners can create a new facility with specified capacity
public fun create_facility(owner: &signer, capacity: u64)
```

### Booking a Spot
```move
// Users can book a spot at any facility by providing the facility owner's address
public fun book_spot(user: &signer, facility_owner: address)
```

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the Aptos CLI installed and configured
2. **Compilation**: Compile the contract using `aptos move compile`
3. **Deployment**: Deploy using `aptos move publish`
4. **Interaction**: Use the Aptos CLI or SDK to interact with the deployed contract
